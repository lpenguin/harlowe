                This is the General Rehearsal. 

To rehears is to repeat and improve. To repeat and to change. Slightly 
shift towards the perfection.

But let us forget for a second about the final product — a play, a song, a film, a scene, an opening line when you call somebody on the phone. 
 
Let us forget for a second about every other possible outcome of constant repetition, augmentation and improvements of ones skill, but focus on the rehearsal in general. On the multiple ways (to perform) to do something. On the set of the possibilities and various ways. 

This is the space to chose a path, a way, a possibility — to build your own narrative, to reflect, to navigate yourself through the corpus of ideas and information, thus creating your own personal story experience.

Or overwrite the existing one.
