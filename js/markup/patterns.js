			using two spaces usually has the same effect as using one space, one tab, and so forth.

			Harlowe tries to also recognise most forms of Unicode-defined whitespace,
			including the quads, the per-em and per-en spaces, but not the zero-width space characters (as they may
			cause confusion and syntax errors if unnoticed in your code).

			Remember that there must be whitespace between the asterisk and the list item text! Otherwise, this markup
			will conflict with the emphasis markup.

			a normal list. Use nested lists for "children" of normal list items.

			with a number corresponding to the item's position in the list.

			Remember that there must be whitespace between the `0.` and the list item text! Otherwise, it will be regarded as a plain

			If you use multiple `0.` tokens (`0.0.`, `0.0.0.` etc.) for the bullet, you will make a nested list, which uses different
			numbering from outer lists, and are indented deeper. Use nested lists for "children" of normal list items.

			Example usage:
			```
			#Level 1 heading renders as an enclosing <h1>

			Aligner markup

			An aligner is a special single-line token which specifies the alignment of the subsequent text. It is essentially
			'modal' - all text from the token onward (until another aligner is encountered) is wrapped in a `<tw-align>` element
			(or unwrapped in the case of left-alignment, as that is the default).

			 * Right-alignment, resembling `==>` is produced with 2 or more `=`s followed by a `>`.
			 * Left-alignment, resembling `<==` is restored with a `<` followed by 2 or more `=`.
			 * Justified alignment, resembling `<==>` is produced with `<`, 2 or more `=`, and a closing `>`.
			 * Mixed alignment is 1 or more `=`, then `><`, then 1 or more `=`. The ratio of quantity of left `=`s and right `=`s determines
			the alignment: for instance, one `=` to the left and three `=`s to the right produces 25% left alignment.
			
			Example usage:
			```
			==>
			This is right-aligned
			=><=
			This is centered
			<==>
			This is justified
			<==
			This is left-aligned (undoes the above)
			===><=
			This has margins 3/4 left, 1/4 right
			=><=====
			This has margins 1/6 left, 5/6 right.

		/*d:
			Link markup

			Hyperlinks are the player's means of moving between passages and affecting the story. They consist of
			*link text*, which the player clicks on, and a *passage expression* that equals the name of the passage
			to send the player to.

			Inside matching non-nesting pairs of `[[` and `]]`, place the link text and the passage expression,
			separated by either `->` or `<-`, with the arrow pointing to the passage expression.

			You can also write a shorthand form, where there is no `<-` or `->` separator.
			The entire content is treated as a passage name, and its evaluation is treated as the link text.

			```
			[[Up to the attic]]
			[["Draw your" + $weapon]]
			```

			Example usage:
			```
			[[Go to the cellar->Cellar]] is a link that goes to a passage named "Cellar".
			[[Parachuting<-Jump]] is a link that goes to a passage named "Parachuting".
			[[Down the hatch]] is a link that goes to a passage named "Down the hatch".
			```

			Details:

			The interior of a link (the text between `[[` and `]]`) may contain any character except `]`. If additional
			`->`s or `<-`s appear, the rightmost right arrow or leftmost left arrow is regarded as the canonical separator.

			```
			[[A->B->C->D->E]] has a link text of
			A->B->C->D
			and a passage name of
			E

			[[A<-B<-C<-D<-E]] has a link text of
			B<-C<-D<-E
			and a passage name of
			A
			```

			This syntax is not the only way to create links â€“ there are many link macros, such as (link:), which can
			be used to make more versatile hyperlinks in your story.
