			using two spaces usually has the same effect as using one space, one tab, and so forth.

			Harlowe tries to also recognise most forms of [Unicode-defined whitespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character#Unicode),
			including the quads, the per-em and per-en spaces, but not the zero-width space characters (as they may
			cause confusion and syntax errors if unnoticed in your code).

			Aligner markup

			An aligner is a special single-line token which specifies the alignment of the subsequent text. It is essentially
			'modal' - all text from the token onward (until another aligner is encountered) is wrapped in a `<tw-align>` element
			(or unwrapped in the case of left-alignment, as that is the default).

			 * Right-alignment, resembling `==>` is produced with 2 or more `=`s followed by a `>`.
			 * Left-alignment, resembling `<==` is restored with a `<` followed by 2 or more `=`.
			 * Justified alignment, resembling `<==>` is produced with `<`, 2 or more `=`, and a closing `>`.
			 * Mixed alignment is 1 or more `=`, then `><`, then 1 or more `=`. The ratio of quantity of left `=`s and right `=`s determines
			the alignment: for instance, one `=` to the left and three `=`s to the right produces 25% left alignment.
			
			Any amount of whitespace is permitted before or after each token, as long as it is on a single line.

			Example usage:
			```
			==>
			This is right-aligned
			  =><=
			This is centered
			 <==>
			This is justified
			<==
			This is left-aligned (undoes the above)
			===><=
			This has margins 3/4 left, 1/4 right
			  =><=====
			This has margins 1/6 left, 5/6 right.

		/*d:
			Column markup

			Column markup is, like aligner markup, a special single-line token which indicates that the subsequent text should be laid out in columns. They consist of a number of `|` marks, indicating the size of the column relative to the other columns - the total width of all columns equals the page width, and this is divided among the columns by their `|` marks. They also have a number of `=` marks surrounding it, indicating the size of the column's margins in CSS "em" units (which are about the width of a capital M).

			All text from the token onward, until the next token is encountered, is contained in the specified column. A `|==|` token ends the set of columns and returns the page to normal.

			Columns are currently laid out from left to right, in order of appearance.
			
			Any amount of whitespace is permitted before or after each token, as long as it is on a single line.

			Example usage:
			```
			|==
			This is in the leftmost column, which has a right margin of about 2 letters wide.
			    =|||=
			This is in the next column, which has margins of 1 letter wide. It is three times as wide as the left column.
			 =====||
			This is in the right column, which has a right margin of about 5 letters wide. It is twice as wide as the left column.
			  |==|
			This text is not in columns, but takes up the entire width, as usual.
			```

			You can create nested columns by enclosing the inner set of columns in a named or macro-attached hook, like so:
			```
			|==
			This is the outer left column.
			==|
			This is outer right column.
			[\
			  |==
			This is the inner left column, inside the outer right column.
			  ==|
			This is the inner right column, inside the outer right column.

			Link markup

			Hyperlinks are the player's means of moving between passages and affecting the story. They consist of
			*link text*, which the player clicks on, and a *passage name* to send the player to.

			Inside matching non-nesting pairs of `[[` and `]]`, place the link text and the passage name,
			separated by either `->` or `<-`, with the arrow pointing to the passage name.

			You can also write a shorthand form, where there is no `<-` or `->` separator.
			The entire content is treated as a passage name, and its evaluation is treated as the link text.

			Example usage:
			```
			[[Go to the cellar->Cellar]] is a link that goes to a passage named "Cellar".
			[[Parachuting<-Jump]] is a link that goes to a passage named "Parachuting".
			[[Down the hatch]] is a link that goes to a passage named "Down the hatch".
			```

			Details:

			The interior of a link (the text between `[[` and `]]`) may contain any character except `]`. If additional
			`->`s or `<-`s appear, the rightmost right arrow or leftmost left arrow is regarded as the canonical separator.

			```
			[[A->B->C->D->E]] has a link text of
			A->B->C->D
			and a passage name of
			E

			[[A<-B<-C<-D<-E]] has a link text of
			B<-C<-D<-E
			and a passage name of
			A

			This syntax is not the only way to create links – there are many link macros, such as (link:), which can
			be used to make more versatile hyperlinks in your story.

			You can also include a `<style>` tag containing CSS code. The CSS should affect the entire page

			Style markup

			| Styling | Markup code | Result | HTML produced
			|---
			| Italics | `//text//` | <i>text</i> |`<i>text</i>`
			| Boldface | `''text''` | <b>text</b> |`<b>text</b>`
			| Deleted/spoiler text | `~~text~~` | <del>text</del> | `<del>text</del>`
			| Emphasis | `*text*` | *text* |`<em>text</em>`
			| Strong emphasis | `**text**` | **text** |`<strong>text</strong>`
			| Superscript | `meters/second^^2^^` | meters/second<sup>2</sup> | `meters/second<sup>2</sup>`

			Example usage:
			```
			You //can't// be serious! I have to go through the ''whole game''
			again? ^^Jeez, louise!^^
			```

			Details:
			You can nest these codes - `''//text//''` will produce ***bold italics*** - but they must nest
			symmetrically. `''//text''//` will not work.

			A larger variety of text styles can be produced by using the (text-style:) macro, attaching it to
			a text hook you'd like to style. And, furthermore, you can use HTML tags like `<mark>` as an additional
			styling option.

			Collapsing whitespace markup

			When working with macros, HTML tags and such, it's convenient for readability purposes to space and indent
			the text. However, this whitespace will also appear in the compiled passage text. You can get around this by
			placing the text between `{` and `}` marks. Inside, all runs of consecutive whitespace (line breaks, spaces)
			will be reduced to just one space.

			Example usage:
			```
			{
			    This sentence
			    will be
			    (set: $event to true)
			    written on one line
			    with only single spaces.
			}
			```

			Details:

			You can nest this markup within itself - `{Good  { gumballs!}}` - but the inner pair won't behave any
			differently as a result of being nested.

			Text inside macro calls (in particular, text inside strings provided to macro) will not be collapsed.
			Neither will text *outputted* by macro calls, either - `{(print:"   ")}` will still print all 3 spaces,
			and `{(display:"Attic")}` will still display all of the whitespace in the "Attic" passage.

			Also, text inside the verbatim syntax, such as `` Thunder`   `hound ``, will not be collapsed either.

			If the markup contains a (replace:) command attached to a hook, the hook will still have its whitespace
			collapsed, even if it is commanded to replace text outside of the markup.

			If you only want to remove specific line breaks, consider the escaped line break markup.

		/*d:
			Named hook markup

			For a general introduction to hooks, see their respective markup description. Named hooks are a less common type of
			hook that offer unique benefits. To produce one, instead of attaching a macro, attach a "nametag" to the front or back:

			```
			[This hook is named 'opener']<opener|

			|s2>[This hook is named 's2']
			```

			(Hook nametags are supposed to resemble triangular gift box nametags.)

			A macro can refer to and alter the text content of a named hook by referring to the hook as if it were a variable.
			To do this, write the hook's name as if it were a variable, but use the `?` symbol in place of the `$` symbol:

			```
			[Fie and fuggaboo!]<shout|

			(click: ?shout)[ (replace: ?shout)["Blast and damnation!"] ]
			```

			The above (click:) and (replace:) macros can remotely refer to and alter the hook using its name. This lets you,
			for instance, write a section of text full of tiny hooks, and then attach behaviour to them further in the passage:

			```
			Your [ballroom gown]<c1| is [bright red]<c2| with [silver streaks]<c3|,
			and covered in [moonstones]<c4|.

			(click: ?c1)[A hand-me-down from your great aunt.]
			(click: ?c2)[A garish shade, to your reckoning.]
			(click: ?c3)[Only their faint shine keeps them from being seen as grey.]
			(click: ?c4)[Dreadfully heavy, they weigh you down and make dancing arduous.]
			```

			As you can see, the top sentence remains mostly readable despite the fact that several words have (click:) behaviours
			assigned to them.

		/*d:
			Hook markup

			A hook is a means of indicating that a specific span of passage prose is special in some way. It
			essentially consists of text between single `[` and `]` marks. Prose inside a hook can be modified, styled,
			controlled and analysed in a variety of ways using macros.

			Anonymous (or simple) hooks are hooks which have a macro or a variable attached to their front. This
			attached value is used to change the hook in some way, such as hiding it based on the game state, altering
			the styling of its text, moving its text to elsewhere in the passage.

			```
			(font: "Courier New")[This is an anonymous hook.

			As you can see, this has a macro instance in front of it.]
			This text is outside the hook.
			```

			The (font:) macro is one of several macros which produces a special styling command, instead of a basic
			data type like a number or a string. In this case, the command changes the attached hook's font to Courier New,
			without modifying the other text.

			You can save this command to a variable, and then use it repeatedly, like so:
			```
			(set: $x to (font: "Skia"))
			$x[This text is in Skia.]
			$x[As is this text.]
			```

			The basic (if:) macro is used by attaching it to a hook, too:

			```
			(if: $x is 2)[This text is only displayed if $x is 2.]
			```

			For more information about command macros, consult the descriptions for each of them in turn.

			Macro markup

			A macro is a piece of code that is inserted into passage text. Macros are used to accomplish many effects,
			such as altering the game's state, displaying different text depending on the game's state, and altering
			the manner in which text is displayed.

			There are many built-in macros in Harlowe. To use one, you must *call* upon it in your passage by writing
			the name, a colon, and some data values to provide it, all in parentheses. For instance, you call the (print:)
			macro like so: `(print: 54)`. In this example, `print` is the macro's name, and `54` is the value.

			The name of the macro is case-insensitive, dash-insensitive and underscore-insensitive. This means that
			any combination of case, dashes and underscores in the name will be ignored. You can, for instance, write
			`(go-to:)` as `(goto:)`, `(Goto:)`, `(GOTO:)`, `(GoTo:)`, `(Go_To:)`, `(Got--o:)`, `(-_-_g-o-t-o:)`, or 
			any other combination or variation.

			You can provide any type of data values to a macro call - numbers, strings, booleans, and so forth. These
			can be in any form, as well - `"Red" + "belly"` is an expression that produces a single string, "Redbelly",
			and can be used anywhere that the joined string can be used. Variables, too, can be used with macros, if
			their contents matches what the macro expects. So, if `$var` contains the string "Redbelly", then `(print: $var)`,
			`(print: "Redbelly")` and `(print: "Red" + "belly")` are exactly the same.

			Furthermore, each macro call produces a value itself - (num:), for instance, produces a number, (a:) an array - so
			they too can be nested inside other macro calls. `(if: (num:"5") > 2)` nests the (num:) macro inside the (if:) macro.

			If a macro can or should be given multiple values, separate them with commas. You can give the `(a:)` macro
			three numbers like so: `(a: 2, 3, 4)`. The final value may have a comma after it, or it may not - `(a: 2, 3, 4,)`
			is equally valid. Also, if you have a data value that's an array, string or dataset, you can "spread out" all
			of its values into the macro call by using the `...` operator: `(either: ...$array)` will act as if every value in
			$array was placed in the (either:) macro call separately
