		A HookSet is an object representing a "hook selection". Hooks in
		Twine passages can have identical titles, and both can therefore be
		selected by the same hook reference. This class represents
		these selections within a given Section.

		In addition to regular hook selections, there is also "pseudo-hooks".
		A "pseudo-hook" is section text selected using a search string, rather
		than a hook tag reference. A macro instantiation like...
			(remove: "cats")
		...would make a pseudo-hook that matches, or "hooks", every instance of
		the string "cats" in the passage. So, without needing to mark up
		that text with hook syntax, the author can still manipulate it intuitively.
		This is a powerful construct!
	*/

	/*d:
		HookName data
		
		A hook name is like a variable name, but with `?` replacing the `$` sigil. When given to a macro that accepts it,
		it signifies that *all* hooks with the given name should be affected by the macro.
		For instance, `(click: ?red)` will cause *all* hooks with a `<red|` or `|red>` nametag to be subject to the (click:)
		macro's behaviour.

		In earlier Harlowe versions, it was possible to also use hook names with (set:), (put:) and (move:) to modify the
		text of the hooks, but macros such as (replace:) should be used to accomplish this instead.

		If you only want some of the hooks with the given name to be affected, you can treat the hook name as a sort of read-only
		array: access its `1st` element (such as by `?red's 1st`) to only affect the first such named hook in the passage, access
		the `last` to affect the last, and so forth. (Even specifying an array of positions, like `?red's (a:1,3,5)`, will work.)
		Unlike arrays, though, you can't access their `length`, nor can you spread them with `...`.

		If you need to, you cal also add hook names together to affect both at the same time: `(click: ?red + ?blue's 1st)` will
		affect all hooks tagged `<red|`, as well as the first hook tagged `<blue|`.

		Note: if a hook name does not apply to a single hook in the given passage (for instance, if you type `?rde` instead of
		`?red`) then no error will be produced. This is to allow macros such as (click:) to be placed in the `header` or `footer`
		passages, and thus easily affect hooks in every passage, even if individual passages lack the given hook name. Of course, it
		means that you'll have to be extra careful while typing the hook name, as misspellings will not be easily identified
		by Harlowe itself.
