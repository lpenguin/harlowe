		Lambda data

		Suppose you want to do a complicated task with an array, like, say, convert all of its strings to lowercase,
		or check if its datamaps have "health" data equal to 0, or join all of its strings together
		into a single string. You want to be able to tell Harlowe to search for "each string where the string's 1st
		letter is A". You want to write a "function" for how the search is to be conducted.

		Lambdas are user-created functions that let you tell certain macros, like (find:), (altered:) and (folded:),
		precisely how to search, alter, or combine the data provided to them.

		There are several types of lambdas.

		* "where" lambdas, used by the (find:) macro, are used to search for and filter data. The lambda `_item where _item's
		1st is "A"` tells the macro to searches for items whose `1st` is the string "A".
		
		* "via" lambdas, used by the (altered:) macro, are used to transform and change data. The lambda `_item via _item + "s"`
		tells the macro to add the string "s" to the end of each item.
		
		* "making" lambdas, used by the (folded:) are used to build or "make" a single data value by adding something from
		each item to it. The lambda `_item making _total via _total + (max: _item, 0)` tells the macro to add each item to
		the total, but only if the item is greater than 0. (Incidentally, you can also use "where" inside a "making" lambda -
		you could rewrite that lambda as `_item making _total via _total + _item where _item > 0`.)

		Lambdas use temp variables as "placeholders" for the actual values. For instance, in `(find: _num where _num > 2, 5,6,0)`,
		the temp variable `_num` is used to mean each individual value given to the macro, in turn. It will be 5, 6 and 0, respectively.
		Importantly, this will *not* alter any existing temp variable called `_num` - the inside of a lambda can be thought
		of as a hook, so just as the inner `_x` in `(set: _x to 1) |a>[ (set:_x to 2) ]` is different from the outer `_x`, the `_num` in the
		lambda will not affect any other `_num`.

		An important feature is that you can save lambdas into variables, and reuse them in your story easily. You
		could, for instance, `(set: $statsReadout to (_stat making _readout via _readout + "|" + _stat's name + ":" + _stat's value))`,
		and then use $printStats with the (folded:) macro in different places, such as `(folded: $statsReadout, ...(dataentries: $playerStats))` for displaying the player's stats, `(folded: $statsReadout, ...(dataentries: $monsterStats))` for a monster's stats, etc.

		Lambdas are named after the lambda calculus, and the "lambda" keyword used in many popular programming languages.
		They may seem complicated, but as long as you think of them as just a special way of writing a repeating instruction,
		and understand how their macros work, you may find that they are very convenient.
