	/*d:
		(enchant: HookName or String, Changer) -> Command

		Applies a changer to every occurrence of a hook or string in a passage, and continues applying that changer to any further
		occurrences that are made to appear in the same passage later.

		Example usage:
		* `(enchant: "gold", (text-colour: yellow) + (text-style:'bold'))` makes all occurrences of "gold" in the text be bold and yellow.
		* `(enchant: ?dossier, (link: "Click to read"))` makes all the hooks named "dossier" be hidden behind links reading
		"Click to read".

		Rationale:
		While changers allow you to style or transform certain hooks in a passage, it can be tedious and error-prone to attach them to every
		occurrence as you're writing your story, especially if the attached changers are complicated. You can
		simplify this by storing changers in short variables, and attaching just the variables, like so:
		```
		(set: _ghost to (text-style:'outline'))
		_ghost[Awoo]
		_ghost[Ooooh]
		```
		Nevertheless, this can prove undesirable: you may want to remove the _ghost styling later in development, which would
		force you to remove the attached variables to avoid producing an error; you may want to only style a single word or phrase,
		and find it inconvenient to place it in a hook; you may simply not like having code, like that (set:) macro,
		be at the start of your passage; you may not want to keep track of which variables hold which changers, given the possibility (if
		you're using normal variables) that they could be changed previously in the story.

		Instead, you can give the hooks the name "ghost", and then (enchant:) them afterward like so:
		```
		|ghost>[Awoo]
		|ghost>[Ooooh]
		(enchant: ?ghost, (text-style:'outline'))
		```
		The final (enchant:) macro can target words instead of hooks, much like (click:) - simply provide a string instead of a hook name.

		This macro works well in "header" tagged passages - using a lot of (enchant:) commands to style certain words or parts of
		every passage, you can essentially write a "styling language" for your story, where certain hook names "mean" certain colours or
		behaviour. (This is loosely comparable to using CSS to style class names, but exclusively uses macros.)

		Details:
		As with (click:), the "enchantment" affects the text produced by (display:) macros, and any hooks changed by (replace:) etc. in the future,
		until the player makes their next turn.

		The built-in hook names, ?Page, ?Passage, ?Sidebar and ?Link, can be targeted by this macro, and can be styled on a per-passage basis this way.

			/*d:
				(replace: ...HookName or String) -> Changer
				
				Creates a command which you can attach to a hook, and replace target
				destinations with the hook's contents. The targets are either text strings within
				the current passage, or hook references.

				Example usage:

				This example changes the words "categorical catastrophe" to "**dog**egorical **dog**astrophe"
				```
				A categorical catastrophe!
				(replace: "cat")[**dog**]
				```

				This example changes the `|face>` and `|heart>` hooks to read "smile":
				```
				A |heart>[song] in your heart, a |face>[song] on your face.
				(replace: ?face, ?heart)[smile]
				```

				Rationale:
				A common way to make your stories feel dynamic is to cause their text to modify itself
				before the player's eyes, in response to actions they perform. You can check for these actions
				using macros such as (link:), (click:) or (live:), and you can make these changes using macros
				such as (replace:).

				Using (replace:) is only one way of providing this dynamism, however - the (show:) macro also
				offers similar functionality. See that macro's article for an explanation of when you might prefer
				to use it over (replace:), and vice-versa.

				Details:
				(replace:) lets you specify a target, and a block of text to replace the target with. The attached hook
				will not be rendered normally - thus, you can essentially place (replace:) commands anywhere in the passage
				text without interfering much with the passage's visible text.

				If the given target is a string, then every instance of the string in the current passage is replaced
				with a copy of the hook's contents. If the given target is a hook reference, then only named hooks
				with the same name as the reference will be replaced with the hook's contents. Use named hooks when
				you want only specific places in the passage text to change.

				If the target doesn't match any part of the passage, nothing will happen. This is to allow you to
				place (replace:) commands in `header` tagged passages, if you want them to conditionally affect
				certain named hooks throughout the entire game, without them interfering with other passages.

			"replace",
			/*d:
				(append: ...HookName or String) -> Changer

				A variation of (replace:) which adds the attached hook's contents to
				the end of each target, rather than replacing it entirely.

				Example usage:
				* `(append: "Emily", "Em")[, my maid] ` adds ", my maid " to the end of every occurrence of "Emily" or "Em".
				* `(append: ?dress)[ from happier days]` adds " from happier days" to the end of the `|dress>` hook.

				Rationale:
				As this is a variation of (replace:), the rationale for this macro can be found in
				that macro's description. This provides the ability to append content to a target, building up
				text or amending it with an extra sentence or word, changing or revealing a deeper meaning.

		/*d:
			(click: HookName or String) -> Changer

			Produces a command which, when attached to a hook, hides it and enchants the specified target, such that
			it visually resembles a link, and that clicking it causes the attached hook to be revealed.

			Example usage:
			* `There is a small dish of water. (click: "dish")[Your finger gets wet.]` causes "dish" to become a link that,
			when clicked, reveals "Your finger gets wet." at the specified location.
			* `[Fie and fuggaboo!]<shout| (click: ?shout)[Blast and damnation!]` does something similar to every hook named `<shout|`.

			Rationale:

			The (link:) macro and its variations lets you make passages more interactive, by adding links that display text when
			clicked. However, it can often greatly improve your passage code's readability to write a macro call that's separate
			from the text that it affects. You could want to write an entire paragraph, then write code that makes certain words
			into links, without interrupting the flow of the prose in the editor.

			The (click:) macro lets you separate text and code in this way. Place (click:) hooks at the end of your passages, and have
			them affect named hooks, or text strings, earlier in the passage.

			Details:

			Text or hooks targeted by a (click:) macro will be styled in a way that makes them indistinguishable from passage links,
			and links created by (link:). When any one of the targets is clicked, this styling will be removed and the hook attached to the
			(click:) will be displayed.

			Additionally, if a (click:) macro is removed from the passage, then its targets will lose the link styling and no longer be
			affected by the macro.

			Targeting ?Page or ?Passage:

			When a (click:) command is targeting the ?Page or ?Passage, instead of transforming the entire passage text into
			a link, something else will occur: a blue link-coloured border will surround the page, and
			the mouse cursor (on desktop browsers) will resemble a hand no matter what it's hovering over.

			Clicking a link when a (click:) is targeting the ?Page or ?Passage will cause both the link and the (click:) to
			activate at once.

			Using multiple (click:) commands to target the ?Page or ?Passage will require multiple clicks from the
			player to activate all of them. They activate in the order they appear on the page - top to bottom.
