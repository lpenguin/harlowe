		/*d:
			(link-goto: String, [String]) -> Command
			
			Takes a string of link text, and an optional destination passage name, and makes a command to create
			a link that takes the player to another passage. The link functions identically to a standard link.
			This command should not be attached to a hook.
			
			Example usage:
			* `(link-goto: "Enter the cellar", "Cellar")` is approximately the same as `[[Enter the cellar->Cellar]]`.
			* `(link-goto: "Cellar")` is the same as `[[Cellar]]`.

			Rationale:
			This macro serves as an alternative to the standard link syntax (`[[Link text->Destination]]`), but has a couple of
			slight differences.

			* The link syntax lets you supply a fixed text string for the link, and an expression for the destination
			passage's name. However, it does not provide any other means of computing the link. (link-goto:) also
			allows the link text to be any expression - so, something like `(link-goto: "Move " + $name + "to the cellar", "Cellar")`
			can be written.

			* The resulting command from this macro, like all commands, can be saved and used elsewhere.
			If you have a complicated link you need to use in several passages, you could (set:) it to a variable and use that variable
			in its place.

			Details:
			As a bit of trivia... the Harlowe engine actually converts all standard links into (link-goto:) macro calls internally -
			the link syntax is, essentially, a syntactic shorthand for (link-goto:).

			of the (undo:) macro. This macro provides a shorthand for placing (undo:) inside a (link:) attached hook.

			You may, as part of customising your story, be using (replace:) to change the ?sidebar, and remove its
			default "undo" link. If so, you can selectively provide undo links at certain parts of your story instead,
			by using this macro.

			Details:
			As with (undo:), if this command is used on the play session's first turn, an error will be produced (as there
			is yet nothing to undo at that time.) You can check which turn it is by examining the `length` of the (history:)
			array.
