	/*d:
		Changer data
		
		Changer commands are similar to ordinary commands, but they only have an effect when they're attached to hooks,
		and modify the hook in a certain manner. Macros that work like this include (text-style:), (font:), (transition:),
		(text-rotate:), (hook:), (click:), (link:), and more.

		You can save changer commands into variables, and re-use them many times in your story:
		```
		(set: $robotic to (font:'Courier New'))
		$robotic[Hi, it's me. Your clanky, cold friend.]
		```

		Changer commands can be combined using the `+` operator: `(set: $x to (text-colour: red) + (font: "Skia"))` sets $x to a command
		that can make a hook's text red-coloured and in Skia. This command can be re-used over and over in your story, and
		is in essence a custom text style.

		```
		(set: $alertText to (font:"Courier New") + (text-style: "shudder") + (text-colour:"#e74"))
		$alertText[This text is red shuddering Courier New.]
		$alertText[Fuel warning: the petrol is upside-down.]
		$alertText[Social alert: no one read the emails you sent yesterday.]
		$alertText[Arithmetic error: I forgot my seven-times-tables.]

		/*d:
			(if: Boolean) -> Changer
			
			This macro accepts only booleans, and produces a command that can be attached to hooks
			to hide them "if" the value was false.
			
			Example usage:
			`(if: $legs is 8)[You're a spider!]` will show the `You're a spider!` hook if `$legs` is `8`.
			Otherwise, it is not run.
			
			Rationale:
			In a story with multiple paths or threads, where certain events could occur or not occur,
			it's common to want to run a slightly modified version of a passage reflecting the current
			state of the world. The (if:), (unless:), (else-if:) and (else:) macros let these modifications be
			switched on or off depending on variables, comparisons or calculations of your choosing.
			
			Details:
			Note that the (if:) macro only runs once, when the passage or hook containing it is rendered. Any
			future change to the condition (such as a (link:) containing a (set:) that changes a variable) won't
			cause it to "re-run", and show/hide the hook anew.

			However, if you attach (if:) to a named hook, and the (if:) hides the hook, you can manually reveal
			the hook later in the passage (such as, after a (link:) has been clicked) by using the (show:) macro
			to target the hook. Named hooks hidden with (if:) are thus equivalent to hidden named hooks like `|this)[]`.

			Alternatives:
			The (if:) and (hidden:) macros are not the only attachment that can hide or show hooks! In fact,
			a variable that contains a boolean can be used in its place. For example:
			
			```
			(set: $isAWizard to $foundWand and $foundHat and $foundBeard)
			
			$isAWizard[You wring out your beard with a quick twisting spell.]
			You step into the ruined library.
			$isAWizard[The familiar scent of stale parchment comforts you.]
			```
			By storing a boolean inside `$isAWizard`, it can be used repeatedly throughout the story to
			hide or show hooks as you please.

		/*d:
			(unless: Boolean) -> Changer
			
			This macro is the negated form of (if:): it accepts only booleans, and returns
			a command that can be attached hooks to hide them "if" the value was true.
			
			For more information, see the documentation of (if:).

			#basics 7

		/*d:
			(else-if: Boolean) -> Changer
			
			This macro's result changes depending on whether the previous hook in the passage
			was shown or hidden. If the previous hook was shown, then this command hides the attached
			hook. Otherwise, it acts like (if:), showing the attached hook if it's true, and hiding it
			if it's false. If there was no preceding hook before this, then an error message will be printed.

			Example usage:
			```
			Your stomach makes {
			(if: $size is 'giant')[
			    an intimidating rumble!
			](else-if: $size is 'big')[
			    a loud growl
			](else:​)[
			    a faint gurgle
			]}.
			```
			
			Rationale:
			If you use the (if:) macro, you may find you commonly use it in forked branches of
			source: places where only one of a set of hooks should be displayed. In order to
			make this so, you would have to phrase your (if:) expressions as "if A happened",
			"if A didn't happen and B happened", "if A and B didn't happen and C happened", and so forth,
			in that order.
			
			The (else-if:) and (else:) macros are convenient variants of (if:) designed to make this easier: you
			can merely say "if A happened", "else, if B happened", "else, if C happened" in your code.
			
			Details:
			Just like the (if:) macro, (else-if:) only checks its condition once, when the passage or hook contaning
			it is rendered.

			The (else-if:) and (else:) macros do not need to only be paired with (if:)! You can use (else-if:) and
			(else:) in conjunction with boolean variables, like so:
			```
			$married[You hope this warrior will someday find the sort of love you know.]
			(else-if: not $date)[You hope this warrior isn't doing anything this Sunday (because
			you've got overtime on Saturday.)]
			```

			If you attach (else-if:) to a named hook, and the (else-if:) hides the hook, you can reveal the hook later
			in the passage by using the (show:) macro to target the hook.

			(if:), (unless:), (else:), (hidden:)

		/*d:
			(else:) -> Changer
			
			This is a convenient limited variant of the (else-if:) macro. It will simply show
			the attached hook if the preceding hook was hidden, and hide it otherwise.
			If there was no preceding hook before this, then an error message will be printed.
			
			Rationale:
			After you've written a series of hooks guarded by (if:) and (else-if:), you'll often have one final
			branch to show, when none of the above have been shown. (else:) is the "none of the above" variant
			of (else-if:), which needs no boolean expression to be provided. It's essentially the same as
			`(else-if: true)`, but shorter and more readable.
			
			For more information, see the documentation of (else-if:).
			
			Notes:
			Just like the (if:) macro, (else:) only checks its condition once, when the passage or hook contaning
			it is rendered.

			Due to a mysterious quirk, it's possible to use multiple (else:) macro calls in succession:
			```
			$isUtterlyEvil[You suddenly grip their ankles and spread your warm smile into a searing smirk.]
			(else:​)[In silence, you gently, reverently rub their soles.]
			(else:​)[Before they can react, you unleash a typhoon of tickles!]
			(else:​)[They sigh contentedly, filling your pious heart with joy.]
			```
			This usage can result in a somewhat puzzling passage source structure, where each (else:) hook
			alternates between visible and hidden depending on the first such hook. So, it is best avoided.

			If you attach (else:) to a named hook, and the (else:) hides the hook, you can reveal the hook later
			in the passage by using the (show:) macro to target the hook.

		/*d:
			(hidden:) -> Changer

			Produces a command that can be attached to hooks to hide them.

			Example usage:
			`Don't you recognise me? (hidden:)|truth>[I'm your OC, brought to life!]` is the same as
			`Don't you recognise me? |truth)[I'm your OC, brought to life!]`.

			Rationale:
			While there is a way to succinctly mark certain named hooks as hidden, by using parentheses instead of
			`<` or `>` marks, this macro provides a clear way for complex changers to hide their attached hooks.
			This works well when added to the (hook:) macro, for instance, to specify a hook's name and visibility
			in a single changer.

			This macro is essentially identical in behaviour to `(if:false)`, but reads better.

			A command that allows the author to give a hook a computed tag name.

			already attached - in the case of `(font:"Museo Slab")[The Vault]<title|`, the nametag results
			in an error. This command can be added with other commands to allow the hook to be named:
			`(font:"Museo Slab")+(hook: "title")`.
			
			Furthermore, unlike the nametag syntax, (hook:) can be given any string expression:
			`(hook: "eyes" + (string:$eyeCount))` is valid, and will, as you'd expect, give the hook
			the name of `eyes1` if `$eyeCount` is 1.

			* "shudder" (causes the hook to instantly appear while shaking back and forth)
			* "pulse" (causes the hook to instantly appear while pulsating rapidly)

			You can use the "none" style to remove an existing style from a combined changer.
			
			Due to browser limitations, hooks using "mirror", "upside-down", "rumble" or "shudder" will have its CSS `display`
			attribute set to `inline-block`.

			(hover-style: Changer) -> Changer

			Given a style-altering changer, it makes a changer which only applies when the hook or expression is hovered over
			with the mouse pointer, and is removed when hovering off.

			Example usage:
			The following makes a (link:) that turns cyan and italic when the mouse hovers over it.
			```
			(hover-style:(text-color:cyan) + (text-style:'italic'))+(link:"The lake")
			[The still, cold lake.]
			```

			Rationale:
			Making text react in small visual ways when the pointer hovers over it is an old hypertext tradition. It lends a
			degree of "life" to the text, making it seem aware of the player. This feeling of life is best used to signify
			interactivity - it seems to invite the player to answer in turn, by clicking. So, adding them to (link:) changers,
			instead of just bare words or paragraphs, is highly recommended.

			Details:
			True to its name, this macro can only be used for subtle style changes. Only the following changers (and combinations
			thereof) may be given to (hover-style:) - any others will produce an error:
			* (align:)
			* (background:)
			* (css:)
			* (font:)
			* (text-colour:)
			* (text-rotate:)
			* (text-style:)
			
			More extensive mouse-based interactivity should use the (mouseover:) and (mouseout:) macros.

			This macro is not recommended for use in games or stories intended for use on touch devices, as
			the concept of "hovering" over an element doesn't really make sense with that input method.

			(mouseover:), (mouseout:)

			Usage example:
			```

			```
			
			Rationale:
			The built-in macros for layout and styling hooks, such as (text-style:),
			are powerful and geared toward ease-of-use, but do not entirely provide
			comprehensive access to the browser's styling. This changer macro allows
			extended styling, using inline CSS, to be applied to hooks.
			
			This is, however, intended solely as a "macro of last resort" - as it requires
			basic knowledge of CSS - a separate language distinct from Harlowe - to use,
			and requires it be provided a single inert string, it's not as accommodating as
			the other such macros.
