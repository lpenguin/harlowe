		Before I continue, I'd like to explain the API for "TwineScript datatype" objects.
		This is an otherwise plain object that may implement any of the following:
		
		{Function|String} TwineScript_ObjectName:
			returns a string that's used when Harlowe needs to
			name the object in error messages or the debug menu.

		{Function|String} TwineScript_TypeName:
			returns a string that's used when Harlowe needs to
			name the type of the object in error messages or the debug menu.
		
		{Function} TwineScript_Clone:
			a function which clones the value, even if it's an oddly-shaped object.
			Should be used exclusively by VarRef.set().
		
		{Function} TwineScript_+:
			a function which is used to overload the + operator. Note that Harlowe
			automatically forces both sides of + to be of identical type.

		{Function} TwineScript_is:
			a function which is used to overload the "is" operator.
		
		{Function} TwineScript_GetElement:
			a function that, if present, is used to obtain integer-indexed elements
			of the object, as if it were an array. Currently used by HookSets.

		{Function} TwineScript_Print:
			a function which is used when the given object is printed into the passage.
		
		{Function} TwineScript_ToString:
			returns a string that's used when the object CAN be implicitly
			coerced to string. This should be used very sparingly.
		
		{Boolean} TwineScript_Unstorable:
			a value that, if present and truthy, means the value cannot be stored using
			(set:) or (put:), nor can be used inside macros with an Any signature.

		{Boolean} TwineScript_Identifiers:
			a value that, if present and truthy, means the object is the Identifiers object
			in Operations. Should be used exclusively by VarRef.set().

		{Boolean} TwineScript_VariableStore:
			a value that, if present and truthy, means the object is either a State's
			variables store, or a Section's temporary variables store.
			in Operations. Should be used exclusively by VarRef.set().

		{Function} toString:
			if this is present and !== Object.prototype.toString, then this is
			used by Section to convert this datatype to renderable TwineMarkup code.
			This is named "toString" so that Array, Function and other objects can be
			interpreted by Section.
