		/*d:
			it keyword

			This keyword is a shorthand for the closest leftmost value in an expression. It lets you write
			`(if: $candles < 2 and it > 5)` instead of `(if: $candles < 2 and $candles > 5)`, or `(set: $candles to it + 3)`
			instead of `(set: $candles to $candles + 3)`. (You can't, however, use it in a (put:) or (move:) macro:
			`(put:$red + $blue into it)` is invalid.)

			Since `it` uses the closest leftmost value, `(print: $red > 2 and it < 4 and $blue > 2 and it < 4)` is the same as
			`(print: $red > 2 and $red < 4 and $blue > 2 and $blue < 4)`.

			`it` is case-insensitive: `IT`, `iT` and `It` are all acceptable as well.

			In some situations, the `it` keyword will be *inserted automatically* by Harlowe when the story runs. If you write an
			incomplete comparison expression where the left-hand side is missing, like `(print: $red > 2 and < 4)`,
			then, when running, the `it` keyword will automatically be inserted into the absent spot - producing, in this case,
			`(print: $red > 2 and it < 4)`. Note that in situations where the `it` keyword would not have an obvious value, such as
			`(print: < 4)`, an error will result nonetheless.

			If the `it` keyword equals a datamap, string, array, or other "collection" data type, then you can access data values
			using the `its` variant - `(print: $red is 'egg' and its length is 3)` or `(set:$red to its 1st)`. Much like the `'s`
			operator, you can use computed values with `its` - `(if: $red's length is 3 and its $position is $value)` will work as
			expected.
